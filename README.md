# Blinkenlights - Minimalistic themes for [n]Vim

A personal take on simplicity using colour to communicate a small number of
semantic elements. These themes assume you're using a terminal that can support
true colour, or a graphical vim like gvim.

## Installation

Assumes you have [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) already.

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'heymatthew/vim-blinkenlights'
call plug#end()
```

```vim
colorscheme blinkenlights
set background=dark " ...moon varient
set background=light " ...dawn varient
```
