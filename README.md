# Ros√© Pine for Vim

All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

A personal take on simplicity. This theme takes Rose Pine using colour to communicate a small number of semantic elements selected by the author.

This assumes you're using a terminal that can support true colour, or a graphical vim like gvim.

## Installation

Assumes you have [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) already.

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'heymatthew/vim-rosepine'
call plug#end()

colorscheme rosepine
set background=dark " ...moon varient
set background=light " ...dawn varient
```
